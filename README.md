# Machine-Learning-Classifiers
In this we will be looking at machine learning classifiers.

1. K-means clustering -- Data clustering technique typically used in unsupervised machine learning
2. CART (Classification and Regression Tree) -- A predictive model, which explains how an outcome variable's values can be predicted based on other values.
3. Random Forest
4. Using TensorFlow to produce synthetic costumer data and then implementing a neural network classifier for binary classification and visualizes tbe decision boundary in a 2D feature space.
